# Inclinometer-using-BNO055-and-ESP8266
This repository hosts code for an IoT-based inclinometer using BNO055 and ESP8266. The project measures tilt relative to gravity, applies sensor fusion for accuracy, and sends data to ThingSpeak for visualization. Additional features include temperature and humidity readings from an SHT2x sensor. Ideal for hobbyists, professionals, or learners.
